# Last Week in RISC-V: Friday September  7, 2018

## Linux 4.19-rc3

On Tuesday I tagged my pull request for Linux 4.19-rc3, which contains
what I hope to be the final RISC-V patch for 4.19.  The patch itself is
fairly boring: it just removes some broken and obsolete code related to
our initramfs support that causes initramfses to start working on RISC-V
systems.  The exciting part here is that this was found by Guenter Roeck
while he was bringing up his CI system, which means we now have CI
running on RISC-V Linux targets!

It's now time to start testing Linux 4.19 on RISC-V systems, let's see
if we can shake out whatever bugs are there before the release.
