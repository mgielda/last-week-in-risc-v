# Last Week in RISC-V: Friday September  7, 2018

## Linux 4.19-rc3

On Tuesday I tagged my pull request for Linux 4.19-rc3, which contains
what I hope to be the final RISC-V patch for 4.19.  The patch itself is
fairly boring: it just removes some broken and obsolete code related to
our initramfs support that causes initramfses to start working on RISC-V
systems.  The exciting part here is that this was found by Guenter Roeck
while he was bringing up his CI system, which means we now have CI
running on RISC-V Linux targets!

It's now time to start testing Linux 4.19 on RISC-V systems, let's see
if we can shake out whatever bugs are there before the release.

## Support for IMAC Systems in Linux

The RISC-V glibc port has supported ABIs without floating-point units
since our original patch submission, but we have yet to properly support
these systems natively in Linux due to a handful of problems with our
port.  Alan Kao from Andes recently published [version 7 of his patch
set](https://lkml.kernel.org/r/1535332075-5727-1-git-send-email-alankao@andestech.com)
that enables support for systems without the F or D extension in our
Linux port.

Since these are fairly major patches and we're outside the merge window
I've added them to our `linux-next` branch, which means they should get
merged during the 4.20 merge window in about 6 weeks.  If anyone is
interested in testing them out on FPU-free hardware (real or emulated)
now is a good time.  I'll let the patches bake for a bit before merging
them into `riscv-linux-4.18`.
