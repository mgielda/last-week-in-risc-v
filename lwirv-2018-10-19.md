# Last Week in RISC-V: Friday October 19, 2018

## glibc Floating-Point Test Suite

As part of the RV32I glibc submission process, Zong from Andes has
submitted a [glibc patch
set](https://sourceware.org/ml/libc-alpha/2018-10/msg00236.html) to fix
a generic floating-point bug that crosses the boundary between GCC and
glibc.  There's been a bit of feedback that, quite honestly, I don't
understand -- the combination of floating-point and glibc macros pretty
much guarantees that I won't be able to read the diff.

Luckily, it appear some smart glibc maintainers have figured out what's
going on and have helped Zong work through some issues.  I look forward
to the v2 patch set!

## binutils-2.31.1 Backports

Kito from Andes has [backported a handful of
fixes RISC-V specific
fixes](https://github.com/riscv/riscv-binutils-gdb/pull/162) to
`binutils-2.31.1`.  The most important fix here is to avoid generating
incorrect executables with PC-relative relocations that have addends, as
was discussed in a previous post.  Like usual, anyone distributing
RISC-V toolchains should update.

## Floating-Point Support in `ptrace()`

Jim has [submitted a patch to add floating-point support to our `ptrace()`
implementation](http://lists.infradead.org/pipermail/linux-riscv/2018-October/001828.html).
There are some interface issues in this version, but I'm sure they'll
get ironed out in time for the 4.20 merge window.
