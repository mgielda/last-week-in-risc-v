## glibc Floating-Point Test Suite

As part of the RV32I glibc submission process, Zong from Andes has
submitted a [glibc patch
set](https://sourceware.org/ml/libc-alpha/2018-10/msg00236.html) to fix
a generic floating-point bug that crosses the boundary between GCC and
glibc.  There's been a bit of feedback that, quite honestly, I don't
understand -- the combination of floating-point and glibc macros pretty
much guarantees that I won't be able to read the diff.

Luckily, it appear some smart glibc maintainers have figured out what's
going on and have helped Zong work through some issues.  I look forward
to the v2 patch set!
