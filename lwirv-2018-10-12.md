# Last Week in RISC-V: Friday October 12, 2018

## GCC 8.2.0 Backports

Kito from Andes has [backported a handful of GCC commits to our release
branch](https://github.com/riscv/riscv-gcc/pull/139).  If you're
distribution RISC-V compilers then I recommend pulling these as well.

## QEMU 3.1 Soft Freeze

QEMU will have their soft freeze for the 3.1 release at the end of
October.  Thanks to Alistair from WD for [collecting a small patch
set](https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/qemu-devel/2018-10/msg01429.html)
and pushing on it so we can get it upstream.  There are still a lot of
patches in the queue, but it's great to have someone helping out!
