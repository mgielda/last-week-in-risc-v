## HiFive Unleashed SD Card Bootrom Bug

Paul recently found a bug in the HiFive Unleashed's bootrom that
manifests when booting directly from the SD card.  The bug manifests
when the Unleashed is hot reset while the SD card is in the middle of a
block transaction.  We'll publish a concrete fix for the issue in our
open source bootloader repo, but since there's no way to fix the mask
ROM in the chip it isn't that useful in the short term.  The bug also
manifests in the FSBL (which is usually in SPI flash) during the
standard boot flow, and assuming the bug is what we think it is the FSBL
fix should be the same as the ZSBL fix.

To work around the bug you simply need to do a second hot reset -- just
try to time that one such that you're not in the middle of another block
transaction :)
