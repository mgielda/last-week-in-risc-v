# Last Week in RISC-V: Friday September 21, 2018

## Introduction to Linux Kernel Development

For those of you interested in getting involved in the RISC-V Linux
kernel porting effort, I wrote a [short
email](http://lists.infradead.org/pipermail/linux-riscv/2018-September/001539.html)
that links to the various sources of information that might help people
get started.

## Developer Room at FOSDEM

I submitted a proposal for a RISC-V developer room at FOSDEM next
February.  Last year our talk went great and a room was suggested, so I
anticipate this will be accepted.  We should officially hear back about
the submission by the end of the month.  Thanks to Karsten for
[starting the thread that got the discussion
started](https://groups.google.com/a/groups.riscv.org/forum/?utm_medium=email&utm_source=footer#!msg/sw-dev/fndi2PKkDGU/ehOGUCQrFQAJ).

## RISC-V Buildroot Patch Submission

*Thanks to Mark Corbin from Embecosm for contributing this section*

I have a (hopefully final) set of patches out for RISCV-64 support on
Buildroot - see
http://lists.busybox.net/pipermail/buildroot/2018-September/230689.html

Until these patches make it into the repository... a version based on
Buildroot 2018.08-rc1 is available at
https://github.com/riscv/riscv-buildroot - see the github wiki for details.
